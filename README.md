This repository will document my journey of learning ML and AI in Python. I will start from the ground up, with solid knowledge in Python but zero profieciency in machine learning.
I hope to organize my notes, show how I learn and what challenges I overcome, and how far I go.

## Here is my list of tutorials I am using:
* [Python NumPy Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI&t=481s) <-- Completed
* [Complete Python Pandas Data Science Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uvysYbKdjM&t=805s) <-- Completed
* [Kaggle Pandas Tutorial](kaggle.com) <-- Completed
* [OpenCV Course - Full Tutorial with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o) <-- Completed
* [PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA&t=2598s) <-- In Progress
